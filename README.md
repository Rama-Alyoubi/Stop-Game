"Stop" is a traditional Saudi game played by two players. Each player has three rocks already arranged horizontally in the front. Each player plays only one move per round. If the rocks meet vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, the player wins the round, as long as at least two rocks are not in their initial position, and each rock must move at least one step. The winner wins three rounds.
